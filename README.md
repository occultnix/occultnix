ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Phoenix Kane!

I'm a self-taught programmer, artist, and designer, currently enrolled in a Game Design degree through Lake Washington Technical Institute.

I'm not active on Github anywhere near as I probably should be, so I apologize for the lack of updates, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to talk!
