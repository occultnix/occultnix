ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Phoenix Kane of Caternary!

I'm a self-taught programmer, game developer, artist, designer, and musician.

Trying to get better about using Git and GitHub for version control and public accountibility, especially now that I'm settled into a pretty stable workflow on Linux (hopefully). Please be patient with me as I get everything hooked up and learn to use GitHub for issue tracking instead of Notepad.
